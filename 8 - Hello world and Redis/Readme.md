# Multiple services

Now we want to connect apps to each other. You can find application code and a  Dockerfile in the dockerApp directory. As the other part, we will use a Redis database. 

Begin by building the image by runmimg `docker build -t hello_http .` in the directory containing the Dockerfile and the code.

We have a container registry available in Azure, so let's use that.

You'll need to retag your image to use the new registry. Use `docker image ls` to find the current tag or use the image id.

```sh
âžœ  ~ docker image ls                                                 
REPOSITORY                                                                      TAG            IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
temp_myapp                                                                      latest         73c8e2f8447f   31 minutes ago   27.2MB
```

Tag your image:
```sh
docker tag 73c8e2f8447f pstrainingregistry.azurecr.io/training/myapp_heini:latest
```

Make sure to use your name or other unique identifier for the image. To be able to push to ACR, we need to authenticate. Run `az acr login` in Azure CLI. You can then push it to the registry like so:
```sh
docker push pstrainingregistry.azurecr.io/training/myapp_heini:latest
```

At this point you can navigate to the ACR resource and validate that the image has been uploaded successfully.

## Redis

Start with Redis. We'll skip creating a PersistentVolume which would be used for persisting the data. All we care about is getting a Redis to respond to our queries. There is a redis-deployment.yaml in this directory. You'll need to create a service to match it. There is a redis-service.yaml file in the same directory. You'll need to edit it to complete the service. It is a good idea to deploy the deployment first and verify it is reachable and then apply the service and verify it is reachable as well.

Tip: Redis uses port 6379 for traffic

## Hello_http

Now you'll need to create a deployment and a service for the hello_http application as well. Follow the same guidelines. Start with the deployment first and test the connection to your Redis service. You'll need to specify the Redis DNS name with an environment variable. In the same namespace you can refer to services just with their names. In the general cluster, services' DNS names follow this syntax:
`my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`

## Bonus 

Implement the same set up by using helm charts!
